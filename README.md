# CoctailMenu

This app developed without third-party libraries and contains such functionality:

List of coctails, loaded from public REST API. List divided into sections according dring category, sections load with pagination. It's possible to filter coctails by category.
UI developed according provided desing.

For architecture I used VIP-cycle from CleanSwift architecture.

Also I implemented small improvements such as:

Empty state in case error during API request
Image caching
