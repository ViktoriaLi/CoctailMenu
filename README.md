# CoctailMenu

This app developed without third-party libraries and contains such functionality:

List of cocktails, loaded from public REST API. List divided into sections according to drink category, sections load with pagination. It's possible to filter cocktails by category. UI developed according to the provided design.

For architecture, I used VIP-cycle from CleanSwift architecture.

Also, I implemented small improvements such as:

Empty state in case error during API request

Image caching
